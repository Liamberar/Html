<b>paris</b> Tower: Louvre Museum: The Louvre is <u> one of the world's largestu </u> and most famous art museums, known for its vast collection of art and historical artifacts. It's home to some of the most renowned works, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The museum's striking glass pyramid entrance has become an iconic image itself.
<b> <br> Elys√©es</b> Under the spell of ancient Roman architecture, Napoleon commissioned Jean Chalgrin the design of a triumphal arch dedicated to the glory of imperial armies. Built in the 19th century, it is the largest monument of its kind in the world. Impressive sculptures adorn its pillars. In addition, the names of 558 generals and the great victories are engraved on the top of the arc. Under the Arc de Triomphe is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of France.
